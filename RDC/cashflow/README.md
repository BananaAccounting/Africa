# Cash Flow for RDC

The BananaApp has been developed following the specific RDC pdf documentations below.

Content:

* [ch.banana.africa.cashflowrdc.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BananaAccounting/Africa/master/RDC/cashflow/ch.banana.africa.cashflowrdc.js): the BananaApp;
* [accounting_2018.ac2](https://github.com/BananaAccounting/Africa/raw/master/RDC/cashflow/accounting_2018.ac2): example Banana file for the current year;
* [accounting_2017.ac2](https://github.com/BananaAccounting/Africa/raw/master/RDC/cashflow/accounting_2017.ac2): example Banana file for the previous year;
* [Formules comptales du tableau de flux de tr√©sorerie.pdf](https://github.com/BananaAccounting/Africa/raw/master/RDC/cashflow/cashflow_documentation.pdf):
	* a document that specifies which data of Banana Accounting to use and how to calculate the various elements of the report.
	* The syntax is **{account/group, column}**, where **account/group** indicates the account or the group of the Accounts table in Banana (groups begins with **Gr=**); the **column** indicates the type of data (Opening, Debit, Credit, Total(debit-credit)) of the Accounts table in Banana.
	* The **(-1)** indicates that the value must be inverted. If positive inverts to a negative value, if negative inverts to a positive value.

## Banana Accounting file settings
In Banana select from the **menu File** the command **File and accounting propeties...**.
### Address
* Select the **Address** tab.
* Insert the **company name** in the Company field.
* Insert the **Designation of the entity number** in the Fiscal number field.
* Insert the **Identification number** in the Vat/Sales tex number.

The data inserted will be used to fill the header information of the report.

### Options
* Select the **Options** tab.
* Insert the **file from previous year**. 

This is optional: if the previous year file is selected it is used to calculate and then insert on the report the data in the EXERCICE N-1 column. If no file is selected, the EXERCICE N-1 column will be empty.

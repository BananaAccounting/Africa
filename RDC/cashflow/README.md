The BananaApp has been developed following the specific RDC pdf documentations below.

Content:

* **ch.banana.africa.cashflowrdc.js**: the BananaApp;
* **accounting_2018.ac2**: example Banana file for the current year;
* **accounting_2017.ac2**: example Banana file for the previous year;
* **Tableau des flux de tresorerie.pdf**: an example of how the report should looks like;
* **Formules comptales du tableau de flux de tr√©sorerie.pdf**:
	* a document that specifies which data of Banana Accounting to use and how to calculate the various elements of the report.
	* The syntax is **{account/group, column}**, where **account/group** indicates the account or the group of the Accounts table in Banana (groups begins with **Gr=**); the **column** indicates the type of data (Opening, Debit, Credit, Total(debit-credit)) of the Accounts table in Banana.
	* The **(-1)** indicates that the value must be inverted. If positive inverts to a negative value, if negative inverts to a positive value.
